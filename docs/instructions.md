# Instructions

## Create an account on GitHub

1. Click on the link to go to [GitHub (https://github.com)][github].
2. Select a user name that you will be comfortable sharing with colleagues and potential employers. If you can get it your name is a good choice.
3. Enter your e-mail.
4. Enter the password you want to use. You may want to type it "in the clear" so that you can be sure it is right. Note that you don't have a password verification box.
5. Once you have created the account click on the avatar in the upper right hand corner and choose Settings from the dropdown menu, then enter your name (as I know you). This is especially important if you didn't use your name as your GitHub username.
6. Then choose Profile from the same dropdown – it will take you to your GitHub profile page. Bookmark this page.

## Practice working with Git and GitHub

At the [GitHub Guides][gh-guides] site you will find a number of quick tutorials that will help you start to learn your way around Git and GitHub.

1. Read the [Understanding the GitHub Flow][gh-flow] guide.
1. Then work through the [Hello World][hello-world] guide.
1. After you have finishe the Hello World guide, click on your GitHub bookmark to return to your profile and notice that you have some new [contribution squares][gh-squares] (you should have at least five).
1. Click on your Hello World repository and you should see that you have, at least, three commits.

Congratulations, you're rolling!
