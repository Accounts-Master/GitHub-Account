Dear Parent or Guardian,

We are about to start creating games in Game Design & Programming class. Whenever possible we use "real world" tools in class. For tracking changes to their code, students use a source code control tool called Git (you can check it out at https://git-scm.org if you are interested) and the website GitHub (https://github.com) to store their code. Git and GitHub are widely used by professional (and amature) software developers.

To use GitHub students need to create an account. They will need an e-mail address that GitHub will use to send a verification e-mail. 

If you have any questions or concerns please let me know. Since I am often busy during the day the best way to get in touch with me is by e-mail. My e-mail address is urner@skschools.org.

Thank you, Doug
