Dear Parent or Guardian,

We are about to start creating games in Game Design & Programming class. Whenever possible we use "real world" tools in class. For tracking changes to their code, students use a source code control tool called Git (you can check it out at https://git-scm.org if you are interested) and the website GitHub (https://github.com) to store their code. Git and GitHub are widely used by professional (and amature) software developers.

To use GitHub students need to create an account. They will need an e-mail address that GitHub will use to send a verification e-mail. 

* Student's own e-mail. If your student will be creating an e-mail address I strongly encourage them to make the address one that they would very comfortably share with potential colleagues, employers, and schools. There are a number of free e-mail services available.
* A family member's account. GitHub will send an e-mail with a link to verify that the e-mail address is working. E-mail will also be sent if it is necessary to reset the password on the GitHub account, or if GitHub needs to notify you about changes to the terms of service or other account related business. The volume of traffic is quite low.

If you have any questions or concerns please let me know. Since I am often busy during the day the best way to get in touch with me is by e-mail. My e-mail address is urner@skschools.org.

Thank you, Doug
